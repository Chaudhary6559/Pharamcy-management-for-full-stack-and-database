    Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of 'understanding' the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.
    
    Text summarization is the process of creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer text document while preserving key information and overall meaning. There are two main approaches to automatic text summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization involves selecting the most important sentences from the original text, while abstractive summarization generates new sentences that may not appear in the original text.
    
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.

    Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, graph neural networks, and recurrent neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs.
    
    Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that has become the foundation for many state-of-the-art natural language processing models. They were introduced in the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' and have since revolutionized the field. The key innovation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element.
