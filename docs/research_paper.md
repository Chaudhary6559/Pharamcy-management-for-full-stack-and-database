# Hybrid Text Summarization: Combining Extractive and Abstractive Methods for Enhanced Performance

## Abstract

This research presents a comprehensive hybrid text summarization system that combines extractive and abstractive methods using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Our approach leverages the strengths of both paradigms: extractive methods for identifying the most important content and abstractive methods for generating fluent, coherent summaries. We implement and evaluate multiple extractive algorithms (TextRank, BERT-based, LexRank) and abstractive models (T5, BART, Pegasus), then combine them using three different hybrid strategies. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the hybrid approach consistently outperforms individual methods, achieving significant improvements in ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore metrics.

## 1. Introduction

Text summarization is a critical task in natural language processing that aims to create concise, accurate, and fluent summaries of longer documents while preserving key information and overall meaning. The field has traditionally been divided into two main approaches:

1. **Extractive Summarization**: Selects the most important sentences from the original text without modification
2. **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates new sentences that may not appear in the original text

While extractive methods excel at preserving factual accuracy, abstractive methods can produce more fluent and coherent summaries. This research explores the potential of combining both approaches to leverage their complementary strengths.

### 1.1 Motivation

Recent advances in transformer-based models have significantly improved the quality of both extractive and abstractive summarization. However, each approach has inherent limitations:

- **Extractive methods** may produce summaries that lack coherence or contain redundant information
- **Abstractive methods** may introduce factual errors or hallucinate information not present in the source

A hybrid approach that combines both methods could potentially address these limitations while maintaining the benefits of each approach.

### 1.2 Contributions

This research makes the following key contributions:

1. **Comprehensive Implementation**: We implement multiple state-of-the-art extractive and abstractive summarization methods
2. **Hybrid Strategies**: We propose and evaluate three different strategies for combining extractive and abstractive methods
3. **Extensive Evaluation**: We provide comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore)
4. **Open Source System**: We release a complete, open-source implementation for research and practical use

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Extractive Summarization

Extractive summarization has a long history in NLP, with several well-established algorithms:

**TextRank** (Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004) applies the PageRank algorithm to a graph of sentences, where edges represent similarity between sentences. It has been widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

**LexRank** (Erkan & Radev, 2004) uses centrality-based scoring to identify important sentences, similar to TextRank but with different similarity calculations.

**BERT-based Methods** leverage pre-trained transformer models to compute sentence embeddings and identify the most important sentences based on semantic similarity.

### 2.2 Abstractive Summarization

Abstractive summarization has seen significant advances with the introduction of transformer models:

**T5** (Raffel et al., 2020) treats summarization as a text-to-text task, achieving strong performance across multiple summarization datasets.

**BART** (Lewis et al., 2020) uses a denoising autoencoder approach, particularly effective for summarization tasks.

**Pegasus** (Zhang et al., 2020) is specifically designed for abstractive summarization, using gap-sentence generation as pre-training.

### 2.3 Hybrid Approaches

Several studies have explored combining extractive and abstractive methods:

- **Two-stage approaches**: Use extractive methods to select important sentences, then apply abstractive methods
- **Ensemble methods**: Combine outputs from multiple extractive and abstractive models
- **Weighted combination**: Linearly combine extractive and abstractive summaries

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 System Architecture

Our hybrid summarization system consists of three main components:

1. **Extractive Module**: Implements multiple extractive algorithms
2. **Abstractive Module**: Implements multiple abstractive models
3. **Hybrid Combination Module**: Combines outputs using various strategies

### 3.2 Extractive Methods

#### 3.2.1 TextRank

TextRank builds a graph where sentences are nodes and edges represent similarity between sentences. The importance of each sentence is computed using the PageRank algorithm:

```
Score(Vi) = (1-d) + d * Σ(Vj∈In(Vi)) (wji / Σ(Vk∈Out(Vj)) wjk) * Score(Vj)
```

Where:
- `d` is the damping factor (typically 0.85)
- `wji` is the similarity between sentences i and j
- `In(Vi)` and `Out(Vi)` are incoming and outgoing edges

#### 3.2.2 BERT-based Extractive

We use sentence transformers to compute semantic similarity between sentences:

1. Encode all sentences using a pre-trained BERT model
2. Compute pairwise cosine similarities
3. Select diverse sentences using Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)

The MMR score is calculated as:
```
MMR = λ * Sim(s, D) - (1-λ) * max(Sim(s, si))
```

Where `Sim(s, D)` is the similarity to the document and `Sim(s, si)` is the similarity to already selected sentences.

#### 3.2.3 LexRank

LexRank uses centrality-based scoring with cosine similarity:

1. Compute sentence similarity matrix using TF-IDF vectors
2. Apply threshold to create adjacency matrix
3. Calculate centrality scores using power iteration

### 3.3 Abstractive Methods

#### 3.3.1 T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

T5 treats summarization as a text-to-text task with the prefix "summarize:". We use beam search with the following parameters:
- Number of beams: 4
- Early stopping: True
- Maximum length: 512 tokens
- Minimum length: 50 tokens

#### 3.3.2 BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)

BART uses a denoising autoencoder approach. We configure it with:
- Number of beams: 4
- Length penalty: 1.0
- No repeat n-gram size: 3
- Maximum length: 1024 tokens

#### 3.3.3 Pegasus

Pegasus is specifically designed for abstractive summarization. We use:
- Number of beams: 4
- Early stopping: True
- Maximum length: 512 tokens
- Minimum length: 50 tokens

### 3.4 Hybrid Combination Strategies

#### 3.4.1 Weighted Combination

Linearly combine extractive and abstractive summaries:

```
Summary = α * Sext + β * Sabst
```

Where `α` and `β` are weights (typically α = 0.4, β = 0.6).

#### 3.4.2 Pipeline Approach

Use extractive summary as input to abstractive model:

```
Sext = ExtractiveModel(text)
Summary = AbstractiveModel(Sext)
```

#### 3.4.3 Ensemble Method

Combine multiple summaries using voting or averaging:

```
Summary = Combine(Sext1, Sext2, Sabst1, Sabst2)
```

### 3.5 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate our system using multiple metrics:

#### 3.5.1 ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)

- **ROUGE-1**: Unigram overlap
- **ROUGE-2**: Bigram overlap  
- **ROUGE-L**: Longest common subsequence

#### 3.5.2 BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)

Measures n-gram precision with brevity penalty.

#### 3.5.3 BERTScore

Semantic similarity using BERT embeddings, providing:
- Precision: How much of the prediction is in the reference
- Recall: How much of the reference is in the prediction
- F1: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
